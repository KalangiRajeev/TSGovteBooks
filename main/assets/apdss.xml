Such notice shall not be unreasonable, or vexatiously given, and must signify’ that it purports to be a notice under the provisions of this clause, and must specify that act or default on the part of the contractor upon which it is based. After such notice shall have been given, the contractor shall not be at liberty to remove from the site or the works, or from the ground contiguous thereto, any plant or materials belonging to him, which shall have been placed thereon for the purpose of the work; and Government shall have a lien upon all such plant and materials, to subsist from the date of such notice being given until the notice shall have been complied with. The Government shall have power to post watchmen at the site of the works and or the ground contiguous thereto in order to prevent the removal of any plant or materials upon which the Government shall have a lien. If the contractor shall fail, for fourteen days after such notice has been given, to comply with the same to the satisfaction of the Executive Engineer as certified by him in writing, Government may enter upon and take possession of the works and site, and of all such plant and materials thereon (or any ground contiguous thereto) and all such plant and materials as above mentioned shall thereupon be at the disposal of Government absolutely, for the purpose of completing the work.

Upon the completion of the works, the Executive Engineer shall certify the amount of the expenses properly incurred consequent on, and incidental to, the default of the contractor as aforesaid and in having the works completed by other persons having credited the contractor with the value of the materials utilized as aforesaid. Should the amount so certified be less than the amount which would have been due to the contractor on the completion of the works by him the difference shall not be paid to the contractor by Government; should the amount of the former exceed the latter, the difference shall be paid by the contractor to Government. Government shall not be liable to make any payment to the contractor on account of the use of such plant for the completion of the works under the provisions hereinbefore contained. Government may at any time give notice in writing to the contractor to remove any of his plant or materials from the site and not required for completion of the works. If such plant and or materials are not removed within fourteen days after notice shall have been so given Government may remove and sell the same, holding the proceeds less the cost of removal and sale, to the credit of the contractor.
In case Government shall exercise the power contained in this clause and shall complete the works by any other person as therein provided, the Executive Engineer, after instituting such inquiries as he may deem fit, with or without notice to the contractor, shall certify what amount (if any) had at the time of the Government exercising such power as aforesaid, been reasonably earned or would reasonably accrue to the contractor in respect of work then actually done by him in the premises and such certificate shall be final and binding on the contractor.
